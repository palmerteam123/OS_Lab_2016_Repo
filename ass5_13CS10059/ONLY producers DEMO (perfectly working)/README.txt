This is a demonstration of just 5 Producers running togther..

To prolong the time of resource acquire, a sleep of 5 seconds has deliberately been introduced.

One can watch the whole demo, just by watching the continuously updating matrix.txt

2 things to note : 
i) There can be mutiple 1 entries in a row, but NEVER more than one entries of 2 
ii) All the 1 entries, eventually become 2, ONLY when the other 2 entry, of the same row turns to 0
